Data stream mining has gained a lot of attention in recent years as an exciting research topic. However, there is still a gap between the pure research proposals and the practical applications to real world machine learning problems. The main goal of this tutorial is to introduce attendees to data stream mining theory and practice. We will use the scikit-multiflow framework to illustrate concepts and also to demonstrate how data stream mining can be easily performed in Python using scikit-multiflow.

The tools and algorithms in scikit-multiflow are specifically designed for the data stream setting. Due to the large amount of data that is created –and must be processed– in real-time streams, such methods need to be time-efficient while using very small amounts of memory. scikit-multiflow is a machine learning framework for multi-output/multi-label and stream data, and is intended to be the open-source gathering point of the research and implementation of data stream methods, while designed to allow practical deployments on real-world applications. scikit-multiflow serves to both researchers and practitioners, as a platform to easily design and run experiments and to easily extend existing methods.

## Target audience

The target audience of this tutorial includes researchers and practitioners, specially if interested on: learning from big data streams, evolving data and/or IoT applications. No previous experience on stream learning is required, but familiarity with traditional batch learning concepts and frameworks (`scikit-learn`) will be a plus.

Data stream mining has gained a lot of attention in recent years as an exciting research topic. However, there is still a gap between the pure research proposals and the practical applications to real world machine learning problems. The main goal of this tutorial is to introduce attendees to data stream mining theory and practice. We will use the `river` library to illustrate concepts and also to demonstrate how data stream mining can be easily performed in Python.

The tools and algorithms in river are specifically designed for the data stream setting. Due to the large amount of data that is created –and must be processed– in real-time streams, such methods need to be time-efficient while using very small amounts of memory. `River` is a Python library for online machine learning. The library is designed for research and implementation of data stream methods, as well as deployment on real-world applications. River serves to both researchers and practitioners, as a platform to easily design and run experiments and to easily extend existing methods.

## Target audience

The target audience of this tutorial includes researchers and practitioners, specially if interested on: learning from big data streams, evolving data and/or IoT applications. No previous experience on stream learning is required, but familiarity with traditional batch learning concepts and frameworks (`scikit-learn`) will be a plus.

## Announcement
In November 2020, `scikit-muiltiflow` and `creme`, the two most popular open-source libraries for stream learning merged into a new library named `river`.
Accordingly, the notebooks are based on `river`, the title of the tutorial was not changed as the conference's program was already announced.

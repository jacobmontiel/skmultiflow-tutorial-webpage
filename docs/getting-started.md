In this tutorial we are going to introduce attendees to data stream mining procedures and examples of big data stream mining applications. Besides the theory we will also present examples using the `scikit-multiflow` framework, a novel open source `Python` framework.

## Recommended installation

For the scope of this tutorial, we recommend the `conda-forge` installation:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge scikit-multiflow
```

**Note:** `scikit-multiflow` only supports Python 3.5+

## Alternatives

If you prefer not to use `conda-forge`, please refer to https://scikit-multiflow.github.io/scikit-multiflow/installation.html/ for available options.

**Note:** This is only recommended for advanced users.
